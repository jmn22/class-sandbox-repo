Respiratory Therapy Device (New)
--------------------------------

### Clinical Problem ###

Pompe disease is a glycogen storage disease (GSD) in pediatric and
adult populations that results in significant neuromuscular
deficits, including cardiac and respiratory failure. While some
pharmacologic treatments are promising to improve cardiac function,
respiratory failure still remains the principle source of morbidity and
mortality.

Current respiratory therapy devices are crude, lack clinician
control, and provide limited-to-no feedback to the patient. Patients
can potentially over-train without this feedback, which can
exacerbate the muscular weakness that they are trying to compensate
for with their therapy.

### Project Objective ###

Design a new inspiration and exhalation respiratory therapy device that
provides therapeutic control, data recording, training safety, and patient
feedback, as specified by your assigned clinician.  The creation of a device
with these features has broad-based application across many diseases and
conditions.
