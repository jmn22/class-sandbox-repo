BME464L Project: Respiratory Therapy Device (New)
=================================================

Fall 2013, Palmeri
------------------

Clinical Problem
    Pompe disease is a glycogen storage disease (GSD) in pediatric and adult populations that results in significant neuromuscular deficits, including cardiac and respiratory failure.  While some pharmacologic treatments are promising to improve cardiac function, respiratory failure still remains a source of morbidity and mortality.

    Current respiratory therapy devices are crude, lack clinician control, and provide limited-to-no feedback to the patient.  Patients can potentially over-train without this feedback, which can exacerbate the muscular weakness that they are trying to compensate for with their therapy.

Project Objective
    Design a new inspiration and exhalation respiratory therapy device that provides therapeutic control, data recording, training safety, and patient feedback, as specified by your assigned respiratory therapist.

Respiratory Therapist
