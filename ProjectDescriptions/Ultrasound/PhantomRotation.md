BME464L Project (Fall 2013, Palmeri)
====================================

Soft Tissue-Mimicking Phantom Rotation Controller
-------------------------------------------------

### Research Problem ###
Medical imaging research is performed on soft tissue-mimicking materials during
the research and development process to avoid the overhead and complexities
introduced with *ex vivo* and *in vivo* studies.  Gelatin-based phantoms with
micron-size scattering particles are commonly used in ultrasound and CT imaging
to mimick soft tissues [1].  During the fabrication of these
phantoms, the gelatin mxiture must be rotated at a constant, prescribed rate
for a specified amount of time to insure that a uniform distribution of
scattering particles is achieved during the crosslinking process.

### Project Objective ###
Design a microcontroller-based device that interfaces with a DC gear motor that
allows a user to specify the rate of rotation as a function of time over a
specied temporal range.  The device should also allow for emergent cessation of
rotation when excessive resistance is encountered by the rotation apparatus and
the ability to notify a user when rotation is complete or has been aborted.
This project can also involve the mechanical design and fabrication of the
rotation transmission mechanism and phantom holding apparatus.
