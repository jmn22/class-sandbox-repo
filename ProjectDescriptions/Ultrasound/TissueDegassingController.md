BME464L Project (Fall 2013, Palmeri)
====================================

Soft Tissue Degassing Controller
--------------------------------

### Research Problem ###
The ultrasonic imaging of excised soft tissue requires that all endogenous and
exogeneous gas bubbles must be removed for good image quality.  The degassing
of soft tissues requires being help under negative pressure for an extended
period of time.

### Project Objective ###
Design a microcontroller-based device that interfaces with a Varian DS 202
vacuum pump to allow a user to define the desired pressure to be held as a
function of time.  Additionally, this device will modulate a gas flow
controller that will exhaust pumped gases into a vented exhause fume hood, in
addition to allowing the chamber to slowly return back to normal atmospheric
pressure.  This device will also provide remote communication to a user about
the status of their pressure chamber as a function of time.
