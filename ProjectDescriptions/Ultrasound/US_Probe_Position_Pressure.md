Ultrasound Probe 6-Axis Position and Pressure Monitor
-----------------------------------------------------

### Clinical Problem ###
Ultrasonic elasticity imaging of the prostate is becoming a popular method to
diagnostically screen and characterize prostate cancer.  Acoustic Radiation
Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging of the prostate is one such modality that has been
invented and is actively being researched here at Duke University.  The
prostate, however, has nonlinear mechanical properties that make its elasticity
measurements dependent on the absolute pressure being applied to it by the
ultrasound probe during.  Additionally, 3D spatial positioning of ARFI images
must be accurately known to allow the imaging plane to be properly aligned to
concurrently acquired B-mode images to guide interventional procedures, and 3D
MR imaging data also acquired for prostate evaluation.

### Project Objective ###
Design a 6-axis position detection system and pressure monitoring system that
can be coupled to an endorectal ultrasound probe for use in ARFI prostate
imaging.  Spatial registration and pressure resolution should be refined as
much as possible.  Transductive elements attached to the transducer must
maintain a flush profile to the transducer to be used for in vivo patient
imaging.  Additionally, pressure and 3D position data can be sent to an Android
Nexus 7 for data display and recording.
