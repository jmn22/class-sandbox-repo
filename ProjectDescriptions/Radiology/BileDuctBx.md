BME464L Project (Fall 2013, Palmeri)
====================================

Liver Bile Duct Biopsy Guidance Device (Interventional Radiology)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Clinical Problem ###
Gaining needle access to the bile ducts in human liver is currently plagued by
high radiation dose to the operator (interventional radiologist) and patient
from the use of x-ray fluoroscopy to visualize the needles in situ.  Bile
ducts, though, have different physiologic properties (e.g., electrical
conductivity and pH) [1-6] that could allow them to be localized using electronic
devices instead of ionizing radiation.

### Project Objective ###
Design a device that can be attached to a bile duct biopsy needle that can
indicate when the needle tip has pierced into, but not through, a bile duct
surrounded by liver parenchyma.
