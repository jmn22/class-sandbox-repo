Human Pharmacology Lab Event Trigger
------------------------------------

### Clinical Problem ###
The Human Pharmacology Lab (HPL) in the Department of Anesthesiology in the
Duke University Medical Center performs complex clinical studies testing
pharmacologic responses and the biological response to physiologic stress.
Studies in the HPL require continuous, concurrent monitoring of many
physiologic systems, including blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate,
arterial blood gas measurements, and bispectral index measurements.  Many of
these systems have been integrated into a LabChart&reg; (ADinstruments)
environment for data display and recording; however, there are limited means by
which a clinician / study staff can record events of interest during a study.

### Project Objective ###
Design a device that allows a clinician / study staff to indicate study events
that can be recorded with the LabChart data collection system.  These events
should have some degree of freedom to be user-defined.  The triggering of these
events should be possible through a variety of mechanisms (e.g., push button,
foot pedal, voice activated, etc.) and must be time synchronized with the
LabChart environment.
