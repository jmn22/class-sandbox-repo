Implantable Epilepsy Device
---------------------------

### Clinical Problem ###
[Cerene Biomedics](http://cerenebiomedics.com/), a startup company that won
the Duke Startup Challenge a few years ago, proposed an implantable device in
the brain that can reduce / prevent focal epileptic siezures by locally cooling
the brain tissue. [1]  The company has since disbanded, but there is still
opportunity for a working prototye device to breathe new life into the effort.

### Project Objective ###
Design a small, battery-powered, implantable device that can provide focal
cooling of the brain surface in response to user perception of an impending
siezure.  The device must be able to reach a target cooling temperature and
hold it for a specified amount of time.
