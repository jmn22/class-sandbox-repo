BME464L Project (Fall 2013, Palmeri)
====================================

Inexpesive, Mobile Air Quality Monitors
---------------------------------------

### Research / Community Problem ###
Air quality in research environments and communities can be of significant
concern with respect to acute and chronic exposures that can lead to cancer,
respiratory infections, asthma, and other repiratory ailments.  Air quality
monitoring devices can be used to alert people of harmful air quality
conditions, but units can be expensive and immobile.

### Project Objective ###
Design an air quality monitoring device that is small, mobile and has extended
battery life.  The device should be able to locally store air quality
information in addition to wirelessly sending that information to an Android
Nexus 7 tablet.
