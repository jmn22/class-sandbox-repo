Lab Procedures & Rules (Teer P012)
==================================

BME464L (Fall 2013, Palmeri)
----------------------------

* Safety in the lab is out #1 priority.  If you ever feel that you are in an environment that is unsafe / you don't know how to use a piece of equipment / something just seems off, then please do not hesitate to ask Dr. Palmeri, Matt Brown or Dongwoon for help.

* Call 911 for all emergencies. A phone is near the restrooms.

* The fire exit, fire alarm, and fire extinguisher are to the right after you leave the lab.

* Wear eye protection during any activity that endangers your sight such as cutting wire or soldering. An eyewash station is in the hall just outside the lab.

* At least two people must be present when working on projects with electrical or mechanical danger.

* Do not touch the gas valve near the sink.

* Do not tell the door lock code to anyone not in the class. "Anyone" includes parents, significant others, peers in other electronics classes, etc.

* Do not prop open the door.

* All instruments (scopes, supplies, meters, etc.) must be locked down to the lab bench or the storage rack. Do not tell the lock combination to anyone not in the class.

* You have been assigned a bench. You are responsible for keeping the area in and around your bench clean, including the floor.

* No food or drink is allowed in the lab.

* You can use the components in the cabinet and on the counter tops. Do not disturb the organization of these components. Do not take entire boxes or bins of components to your bench.

* The test equipment, tools, and test cables are community property. You cannot horde these. Only take what you need. Other teams have permission to take anything that is unused off your bench.

* The blue drawers to the left of the component cabinet are community property. Take one or two if you need them. Do not hide cables, components, test equipment, etc. in your drawers.

* More safety info is available on the chart by the door and at http://www.safety.duke.edu.
