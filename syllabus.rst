:Attendance: Lecture / lab attendance _and_ participation count for 10% of your class grade.  I understand that students will have to miss class / lab for job and school interviews, personal reasons, illness, etc.  Absences will be considered *excused* if they are communicated to Dr. Palmeri at least 48 hours in advance or through submission of Short Term Illness Form (STIF) [ADD URL HERE!!].   Unexcused absences will count against the attendance and participation component of your class grade.
