==================================

Class Syllabus (Fall 2013, Palmeri)
------------------------------------

:Instructor: Dr. Mark Palmeri (mark.palmeri@duke.edu)

:Lab Master: Matt Brown (matt.brown@duke.edu)

:Class Schedule: All class activites are being managed in a Google Calendar that is linked to the class website listed below.  XML, iCal and HTML links are available to make this calendar accessible in your calendar service of choice.

:Class Website: http://mlp6.github.io/Medical-Instrument-Design/  This website is actually
                a git repository hosted and rendered by GitHub! Please be sure
                to check the website often for announcments, deliverable
                deadlines, project resource, and useful tips as your projects
                progress throughout the semester.  Content changes on the
                website will be tracked through the commit history to the git
                repository used to manage class resources by Dr. Palmeri.
                Significant changes and additions to the website will be
                announced by email.

:Attendance: Lecture / lab attendance _and_ participation count for 10% of your class grade.  I understand that students will have to miss class / lab for job and school interviews, personal reasons, illness, etc.  Absences will be considered *excused* if they are communicated to Dr. Palmeri at least 48 hours in advance or through submission of Short Term Illness Form (STIF) [ADD URL HERE!!].   Unexcused absences will count against the attendance and participation component of your class grade.

:Office Hours: Dr. Palmeri has scheduled office hours on XXXX from XXXX to XXXX.  Other days / times are always available by appointment, and there is an open-door policy active all semester (i.e., if my office door is open, then you are welcome to pop in).

:Textbooks & References: Coming Soon!

:Electronic Lab Notebooks: LabArchives or GitHub

:Duke Community Standard & Academic Honor: 

    Engineering is inherently a collaborative field, and in this class, you are
    encouraged to work collaboratively on your projects.  The work that you
    submit must be the product of your and your group's effort and
    understanding.  All resources developed by another person or company, and
    used in your project, must be properly recognized.
 
    All students are expected to adhere to all principles of the Duke Community
    Standard: http://www.integrity.duke.edu/standard.html  Violations of the
    Duke Community Standard will be referred immediately to the Office of
    Student Conduct.

    Please do not hesitate to talk with Dr. Palmeri about any situations
    involving academic honor, especially if it is ambiguous what should be
    done.

:Words of "Wisdom":
    * Do **not** procrastinate on your projects.  It might appear that you have
      the entire semester to design and build your device, but you actually
      have less-than 8 weeks.

    * Document everything in your electronic lab notebook.  You never know what
      small detail you may need to remember in the future.

    * Try to test code **before** you upload it onto your microcontroller.

    * With respect to git: commit, commit, commit!!  Make changes and additions small and modular.
